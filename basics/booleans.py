# It is possible convert Strings to boolean

print(bool(''))         # It is a boolean

# Boolean conversions rule
#trivial values        => False
#non-trivial values    => True

# It's also possible convert boolean to another types
str(True)       # It is a string
str(False)      # It is a string
int(True)       # It is a integer
int(False)      # It is a integer

# It is also possible use arithmetics operatos with boolean and others types
print(5 + True)     # 1 is equal True, and vice-versa
print(10 * False)   # 0 is equal False, and vice-versa
